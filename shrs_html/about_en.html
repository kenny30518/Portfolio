          The Shih Hsin Radio Station’s first official broadcast was aired in 1958 on September 1, celebrated in Taiwan as Journalists Day. It was the first radio station in Taiwan established as a school affiliate with the purpose of offering students internship and research opportunities. Shih Hsin is also the only current school radio station not with AM and FM broadcasts but also with Digital Audio Broadcasting and Web Broadcasting.<br />
          <br />
          In addition to serving its listeners with programs, the radio station’s major purpose is to coordinate with related academic departments and schools at the University to provide rigorous training of broadcast workers, and nurture outstanding talents for hire by the country’s radio station. In order to fulfill the school’s role in media education, the radio station has integrated and taken advantage of resources from various departments and schools, guiding and training all interested students who wish to develop a second specialty in radio broadcasting, to provide additional career choices and competitive advantages in the job market.

          The Shih Hsin radio station is positioned as the scholar’s station, and has development language learning programs to provide listeners with education information and opportunities. This is the development and production theme. The radio’s broadcast programs are widely varied, ranging from variety shows, to those focusing on information technology, English, and Japanese, as well as satellite broadcasts of BBC and Deutsch Wella programs. In order to accommodate the latest broadcasting trends, the station has added live broadcast programs, using six direct phone lines to make the voice of listeners heard in real time, as well as train students’ ability to respond quickly and provide experience in actual interaction with the public. Beginning on may 15, 2000, real-time Web broadcasts officially began, and listeners can listen to AM729 broadcasts over the Internet.<br />
          <br />
          The station’s programs are produced and broadcast by students at the University who are interested in broadcasting, regardless of major. In the process of producing and broadcasting, a professionally trained faculty member is right there to offer help, answer questions-the result is that working at the radio station is an awesome training opportunity for students. The radio station has been a training ground for a huge number of broadcast professionals. It’s very nearly true that anywhere you go in the field, there are Shih Hsih alumnis who spent some time at the University’s radio station.
          Due to the digitalization and automation trends in the broadcasting industry, the Shih Hsin Radio Station completed the setup of two workstations in 1998, making it the first among Taiwan’s university and vocational college radio stations to “go digital”. In July of 2000, student trainees at the radio station were not only able to handle the recording and broadcast studios, adept at both analog and digital recording techniques, and demonstrating their ability to control the entire broadcasting process.

          To give students a more diverse range of skills and knowledge, the station came across the boundary of the traditional broadcasting signal coverage and started the pretest of the Internet broadcasting in order to serve more audiences in 2001. On the radio’s web site, the audience not only can listen to the live programs, but also can watch the every single movement of the DJ in the studio. In January 2002, the radio accomplished the experiment of the Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB).<br />
          <br />
          The Shih Hsin Radio Station is expected to set up the platform where both the live and Audio on Demand (AOD) listening functions will be provided in January 2003. At that time the Shih Hsin University will become the only university with AM, FM, Web and digital broadcasting systems in Taiwan. After the all-direction training within the above-mentioned systems our students then will be capable to do any kinds of jobs related to the broadcasting industry upon the graduation in the future.
